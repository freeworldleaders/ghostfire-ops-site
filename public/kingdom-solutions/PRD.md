# PRD — Kingdom Solutions

## 1. Product summary
Kingdom Solutions is a privacy-first app that helps people record and preserve their life stories and testimonies, optionally transforming them into publishable outputs (book draft, audiobook script, short clips) using assistive tools.

## 2. Primary users
1) Individuals preserving personal testimony  
2) Families preserving shared history  
3) Community historians / creators (opt-in monetization)

## 3. Core user goals
- Record a story quickly (audio/video/text)
- Keep it private by default
- Organize and revise into a coherent narrative
- Export/share on their terms
- (Optional) monetize via creator storefront / licensing

## 4. MVP scope
### Must-have
- Account + authentication

- Record/upload audio/video
- Transcription (optional toggle)
- Story editor (chapters/sections)
- Permissions: private / unlisted / public
- Export: PDF/Doc draft (v1), audio script (v1)
- Reporting + moderation pipeline (basic)

### Nice-to-have
- Collaborative family invites

## 5. Non-goals (MVP)
- Social network feed
- Unmoderated public uploads
- Auto-publishing
- Model training on user private data

## 6. Key flows
- Onboarding → consent + privacy defaults
- Create story → record/upload → (optional) transcribe → edit → export
- Opt-in sharing → publish to profile or private link
- Opt-in monetization → payout setup → listing creation

## 7. Success metrics
- % users completing first recording
- Time-to-first-story (TTFS)
- Retention at 7/30 days
- Export conversion rate
- Report rate and response SLA

## 8. Risks & mitigations
- Privacy breach → strong access controls + audit logs + encryption
- Exploitation of stories → strict T&S + clear reporting + takedown policy
- “AI did it wrong” → human review + undo + “AI suggestions” only
