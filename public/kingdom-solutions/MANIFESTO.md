# About / Manifesto (Public)

Kingdom Solutions is a digital preservation platform for testimonies, family history, and lived experience.

## Our belief
People—not platforms—should control their stories.

## What we do
- Help you **record** (audio/video/text)
- Help you **organize** (chapters, themes, timelines)
- Help you **export** (book, audiobook script, clips) — optional
- Help you **share** — only when you choose

## What we will not do
- We do not claim ownership of your content.
- We do not publish anything without your permission.
- We do not require you to adopt any ideology or belief system.

## The promise
Dignity. Consent. Ownership. Clarity.
